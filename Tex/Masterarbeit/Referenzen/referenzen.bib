  abstract = { Various techniques are described to measure, small displacements
	of television images. If two successive video frames are considered,
	their differences are approximately a linear combination of the components
	of the displacement of the object. If all the points of the frame
	undergo the same movement, then the velocity estimation problem is
	solved using linear estimation. However, if some points belong to
	the moving object and the others to the background, the problem can
	be stated in the same way only if an algorithm is available to segment
	the image into fixed and moving areas. Afterwards, linear estimation
	can be applied to the moving area only. In this paper a segmentation
	algorithm is proposed which uses dynamic programming (Viterbi algorithm
	with three states). A more complex situation arises when the points
	belonging to the moving area are subjected to different movements.
	The problem can be solved once more using dynamic programming if
	the displacement components are quantized into(2M + 1) (2M + 1)values,
	and the number of states of the Viterbi algorithm is augmented to(2M
	+ 1)^{2}. To reduce the technical difficulties of this approach,
	a simpler method that makes possible the estimation of thenmost probable
	displacements is proposed. Then the image is segmented into n moving
	areas with different displacements and a background area using a
	Viterbi algorithm withn + 1states. Experimental results show that
	the precision obtainable is about 0.1 pel when the displacements
	are up to 2-3 pels, the object had approximate dimensions of90 times
	90pels, and the signal-to-noise ratio was higher than 33 dB.},
